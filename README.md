# logistic_Regression_From_Scratch



This project contain implementation of logistic regression from scratch .

The logistic regression is classification technique which uses gradient descent to minimize the cost function.

There are couple of function which defines sigmoid ,cost function and derivate of cost function for minimizing loss using gradient descent.To the performance of the function or logistic regression ,i used cifar-10 dataset and fit the custom built logistic regression that dataset.Since it is multiclass classification ,i implemented one function but that function 10 times to classify the cifar-10 dataset.Additionally i plotted weights in the form of images to visualize the correspending classes.
